  <h1>Things you can do to increase your oxygen level (non emergency)</h1>
  <div class="subtitle">
    1. Open your windows. Fresh air will bring additional oxygen into your home
    and even if you are constantly breathing in oxygen through a cannula,
    whenever you talk or open your mouth fresh air containing higher oxygen
    levels can be drawn into your body. If you live in a smoggy area then you
    could consider investing in an air-filtration system.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">
    2. Plants. They are the opposite of us as they take-in carbon dioxide and
    expel oxygen. Thereby increasing the foliage and plants in your home will
    decrease the carbon dioxide and increase the oxygen levels in your home.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">
    3. Aroma. Many of the chemical-filled candles and various other incense type
    products actually contain carcinogens. Instead it is better to burn
    all-natural beeswax candles as then youâ€™ll have better luck breathing in
    oxygen.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">
    4. Exercise. Even a small amount of exercise will help to improve your
    respiration ability, as your breathing rate increases and deepens your lungs
    can absorb more oxygen.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">
    5. Increase your water intake. Water is made up of oxygen so by increasing
    your water consumption you can increase the amount of oxygen in your body.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">
    6. Go Green. Eating more fresh, raw green juices is beneficial as they are
    full of vitamins and minerals which your body utilises to aid in the uptake
    of oxygen.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">
    7. Meditation. Daily meditation or just simply sitting quietly and focusing
    on your breathing and taking deep breaths for a few minutes can greatly help
    in reducing stress and improving your oxygen intake.
  </div>
  <div class="subtitle">
    8. Eat lron-rich foods. Your diet can seriously impact your oxygen levels.
    Certain foods can help improve your oxygen levels in the blood naturally.
    Target iron-rich foods such as meats, poultry, fish, legumes and green leafy
    vegetables as they can improve iron deficiency, which in turn improves blood
    oxygen levels.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">
    9. Cut out Salt. A diet low in sodium can lead to increased oxygenation via
    the kidney and the blood.
  </div>

  <div class="subtitle">
    10. Eat green raw foods. Oxygen-rich foods can naturally increase your blood
    oxygen levels. Try eating more green vegetables like kale, broccoli and
    celery in order to boost your oxygen levels and hopefully breathe easier.
